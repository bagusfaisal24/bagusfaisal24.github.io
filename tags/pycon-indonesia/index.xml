      <description>Some time ago I attended the 2019 pycon conference in Surabaya, East Java. Pycon is an annual event held by the Indonesian python programming language community (python id).
The interesting thing at the Pycon conference is the event that contains python programming material, such as learning machines, big data, and others.
In addition to the pycon conference held in Indonesia, there were also some foreign developers including India, Japan, the Philippines, and Europe.</description>
